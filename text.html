    <h2>Let It Be</h2>
    <h3>When I find myself in times of trouble
        Mother Mary comes to me <br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br>
        And in my hour of darkness
        She is standing right in front of me<br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br>
        Let it be, let it be...<br>
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.<br>
        And when the broken hearted people
        Living in the world agree,<br>
        There will be an answer, let it be.<br>
        For though they may be parted there is
        Still a chance that they will see<br>
        There will be an answer, let it be<br>
        Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be. <br>
        There will be an answer, let it be.<br>
        And when the night is cloudy,
        There is still a light that shines on me,<br>
        Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.<br>
        I wake up to the sound of music
        Mother Mary comes to me<br>
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.<br>
        Let it be, let it be.<br>
        There will be an answer, let it be.<br>
        Let it be, let it be,<br>
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.</h3>
