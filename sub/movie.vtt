0:00:18.600 --> 0:00:21.680
a Robert Zemeckis film. Marty lives an Ordinary life.

0:00:21.820 --> 0:00:25.600
No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

0:00:25.960 --> 0:00:27.580
Well, history is gonna change.

0:00:28.020 --> 0:00:31.920
And 1985 is not his year.

0:00:32.280 --> 0:00:35.500
But Dr Brown is about to change all that.

0:00:35.720 --> 0:00:37.400
Are you telling me that you built the time machine

0:00:37.520 --> 0:00:39.220
- out of a DeLorean?

0:00:39.880 --> 0:00:43.660
He's sending marty 30 years back in time.

0:00:45.320 --> 0:00:46.380
It worked!

0:00:46.700 --> 0:00:48.880
It's a flying saucer from outer space!

0:00:50.020 --> 0:00:52.480
Now he's trapped in the past...

0:00:52.720 --> 0:00:53.720
This's gotta be a dream.

0:00:53.940 --> 0:00:54.820
...about to meet...

0:00:55.060 --> 0:00:55.560
Chocolate!

0:00:55.740 --> 0:00:56.720
His future father

0:00:56.870 --> 0:00:58.640
He's a peeping Tom.

0:00:59.860 --> 0:01:02.840
And he's making an impression on his mother.

0:01:03.100 --> 0:01:04.600
He's an absolute dream!

0:01:04.880 --> 0:01:07.020
And he can sleep in my room.

0:01:07.520 --> 0:01:10.000
And if you do cause serious repercussions on future events...

0:01:11.260 --> 0:01:14.600
Now, he's got to make his mother and father fall in love.

0:01:15.040 --> 0:01:16.700
I haven't even been born yet.

0:01:16.700 --> 0:01:18.160
And only Dr Brown...

0:01:19.310 --> 0:01:21.290
...can help him get...

0:01:21.290 --> 0:01:23.120
...Back to the future.

0:01:23.120 --> 0:01:25.040
Do you mean this sucker is nuclear?!

0:01:25.780 --> 0:01:26.780
Precisely!

0:01:26.780 --> 0:01:28.160
Michael J. Fox

0:01:28.340 --> 0:01:29.000
Wow, this is heavy.

0:01:29.140 --> 0:01:29.900
Christopher Lloyd

0:01:30.400 --> 0:01:33.240
There's that word, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future?

0:01:33.360 --> 0:01:34.920
Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

0:01:35.780 --> 0:01:37.780
